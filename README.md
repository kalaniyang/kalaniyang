## 🍵 About Me!
---
- 📓 GIT student @ ASU
- ☕️ Barista by Day, Designer by Night
- 💻 Interested in design, media, and web development. I enjoy learning how creativity and technology intersect, especially through visual design and front-end work. I care a lot about *why* we design things, not just how.
